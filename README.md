## Dependency Injection v2

### Installation
```bash
# Install all the the dev deps, such as Karma, Grunt, ...
npm install

# If you wanna use "karma" or "grunt" commands, install also
npm install -g karma-cli
npm install -g grunt-cli
```

### Running the [tests](./test/)

In your Chrome, be sure to enable Harmony support and relaunch, if you haven't
done so: chrome://flags/#enable-javascript-harmony

Then run the test suite:

```bash
karma run
```

# Transpile ES6 into ./compiled/*
grunt traceur

# Watch all the sources and transpile on any change
grunt watch
```

grunt traceur
grunt serve
```
